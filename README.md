# Simple-SideChain-Bridge-for-CheapEth-chain

This is an Initial sidechain bridge implementation prototype used to transfer tokens from mainet to CheapEth Sidechain. 

What is a bridge? 
A cross-chain bridge allows users to transfer tokens, smart contract events, or data between different blockchains. This ensures that different blockchains can interoperate with each other securely.
